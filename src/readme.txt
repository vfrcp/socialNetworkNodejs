//About
This is a pet project that I wrote to learn sql
This is a kind of social network like Twitter. But with less functionality)
The main emphasis was placed on working with the database.
Therefore, there is no authorization as such. I usually do it with jwt tokens.
There are examples in other projects.
For example here https://github.com/vfrcp/SomethingLikeShop
Access is provided by the authorization header with the user's id.

//How to start
1. Install postgresql.
2. Fill the config file.
3. Install dependencies by "npm i".
3. Init database by "npm run initDatabase". If you received a done answer, then everything went well.
4. Compile build by "npm run build" or just start without build by "npm run dev".
5. Start build by "npm run start".
